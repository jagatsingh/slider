PROJECT SLIDER

SLIDER: A collection of tools and technologies to simplify the packaging, deployment and management of long-running applications on YARN.

Availability (always-on) - YARN works with the application to ensure recovery or restart of running application components.
Flexibility (dynamic scaling) - YARN provides the application with the facilities to allow for scale-up or scale-down
Resource Mgmt (optimization) - YARN handles allocation of cluster resources.
